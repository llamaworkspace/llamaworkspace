        Why Llama Workspace?
      </h1>
      <p>
        ChatGPT is an incredible product. It&apos;s made a huge impact on
        society, from education to professional spaces, and its adoption is
        unprecedented. We all know it&apos;s going to reshape industries and
        even change jobs as we know them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here&apos;s the thing: when a product is that powerful, impactful
        and transformative, we believe it should be as open and accessible as
        possible. People should be able to tweak it, make it their own, and not
        feel locked with one vendor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest Large Language Model providers, like OpenAI and Anthropic,
        have chosen to build their user-facing AI assistants with a closed
        approach. And that&apos;s totally understandable: they&apos;re running
        massive businesses and need to make it work financially. But we think
        there should be an option for organizations that want something more
        customizable. Whether it&apos;s for privacy reasons, avoiding being tied
        to one model, or simply to save money, Llama Workspace offers that
        alternative.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also feel that open-source AI models have reached a point where
        they&apos;re fully capable of competing with the big players.
        What&apos;s been missing, though, is a workplace-focused chat
        interfaceâ€”something that includes collaboration, insights, integrations,
        and compliance all in one. That&apos;s where Llama Workspace comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission in the end is to be that alternative, so that you get the
        power of Large Language Models, with the freedom to customize it to your
        needs, and passing to you as many savings as possible.
