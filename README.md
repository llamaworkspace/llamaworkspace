## About

Llama Workspace is an open source & extensible ChatGPT Teams/Enterprise alternative. It helps organizations to:

- **Cut between 50% and 75% the cost of running an AI assistant** in the workplace.
- **Centralize access to generative AI tools** in a single interface.
- **Retain full control over sensitive data** by hosting the product on their infrastructure.

## Features

- **User & permissions management**: Manage people access & decide who has access to which apps.
- **All Large Language Models in one place**: Ask questions to GPT-4, Claude, Mistral or any other major Large Language Model.
- **Apps / GPTs**: Create apps for repeatable use cases and share them across teams.
- **Chat with documents and data**: Upload documents and ask questions to them.
- **Build AI chats with your own code**: [Javascript SDK](https://docs.llamaworkspace.ai/javascript-sdk/installation) to build your own AI workflows.
- **Straightforward self-hosting**: Get up and running with a fewest possible number of commands.
